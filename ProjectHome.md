We're 2 University of Alberta students/alumni looking for a way to display some stats from GDGT during GDGT Live in Seattle, so we've built our own personal live-updating name tag! It uses an Arduino Fio, a Bluetooth Bee module, and a 3.3V lipo battery pack to talk to an Android phone! All the source, including the hardware diagram, parts we used, Arduino sketch files, and Android application, is committed here!
